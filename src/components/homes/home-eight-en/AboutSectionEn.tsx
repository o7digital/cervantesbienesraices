                <p className="mb-3">
                  At Cervantes Bienes Raíces we believe that a property is more than a real-estate asset: it is a lifestyle decision, a long-term investment and a personal milestone. Our philosophy is built on three core principles:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-style-one">
                  <li><strong>Trust</strong> — We create long-term relationships based on integrity, confidentiality and full transparency.</li>
                  <li><strong>Precision</strong> — Every recommendation is backed by real market analysis, premium segment insights and accurate comparative data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Excellence</strong> — We aim to secure the best value for our clients, whether in location, price, investment potential or quality of life.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-0">
                  Our mission is to serve as a strategic partner for our clients, guiding them with professional rigor in every real-estate decision.
